# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: April 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to fork a project on Git. Finished cssgridgarden.com tutorial

**Thoughts**: I didn't retain all of the information from the css grid tutorial yesterday, had to refresh my memory. I'm slowly getting all of my accounts set up and actually doing things with them!

### Day 1: April 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: cssgridgarden.com tutorial, continued progress on portfolio project for freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making progress with learning CSS and HTML and how to implement it.  It's really helpful to look at other people's projects, I'm starting to be able to look at a website and know how it's put together.
